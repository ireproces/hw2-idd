Title: PrivacyGuard: A Modular Framework for Privacy Auditing in

Abstract: The increasing deployment ofMachineLearning(ML) models in sensitive domains motivates the need for robust, practical privacy assessment tools. PrivacyGuard is a comprehensive tool for empirical differential privacy (DP) analysis, designed to evaluate privacy risks in ML models through state-of-the-art inference attacks and advanced privacy measurement techniques. To this end, PrivacyGuard implements a diverse suite of privacy attack-- including membership inference , extraction, and reconstruction attacks -- enabling both off-the-shelf and highly configurable privacy analyses. Its modular architecture allows for the seamless integration of new attacks, and privacy metrics, supporting rapid adaptation to emerging research advances.

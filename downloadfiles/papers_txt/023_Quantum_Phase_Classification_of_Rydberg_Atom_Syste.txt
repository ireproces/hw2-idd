Title: Quantum Phase Classification of Rydberg Atom Systems Using Resource-Efficient Variational Quantum Circuits and Classical Shadows

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions in Rydberg atom arrays present significant opportunities for studying many-body physics, yet distinguishing between different ordered phases without explicit order parameters remains challenging. We present a resource-efficient quantummachinelearningapproach combining classical shadow tomography with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) for binary phase classification of Z2 and Z3 ordered phases. Our pipeline processes 500 randomized measurements per 51-atom chain state, reconstructs shadow operators, performs PCA dimensionality reduction (514 features), and encodes features using angle embedding onto a 2-qubit parameterized circuit. The circuit employs RY-RZ angle encoding, strong entanglement via all-to-all CZ gates, and a minimal 2-parameter ansatz achieving depth 7. Training via simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) with hinge loss converged in 120 iterations. The model achieved 100% test accuracy with perfect precision, recall, and F1 scores, demonstrating that minimal quantum resources suffice for high-accuracy phase classification. This work establishes pathways for quantum-enhanced condensed matter physics on near-term quantum devices.â–³ Less

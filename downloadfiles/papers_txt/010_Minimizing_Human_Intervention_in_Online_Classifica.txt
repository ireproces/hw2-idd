Title: Minimizing Human Intervention in Online Classification

Abstract: We introduce and study an online problem arising in question answering systems. In this problem, an agent must sequentially classify user-submitted queries represented bydd-dimensional embeddings drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The agent may consult a costly human expert for the correct label, or guess on her own without receiving feedback. The goal is to minimize regret against an oracle with free expert access. When the time horizonTTis at least exponential in the embedding dimensiondd, one canlearnthe geometry of the class regions: in this regime, we propose the Conservative Hull-based Classifier (CHC), which maintains convex hulls of expert-labeled queries and calls the expert as soon as a query lands outside all known hulls. CHC attains\mathcal{O}(\log^d T)\mathcal{O}(\log^d T)regret inTTand is minimax optimal ford=1d=1. Otherwise, the geometry cannot be reliablylearnedwithout additional distributional assumptions. We show that when the queries are drawn from a subgaussian mixture, forT \le e^dT \le e^d, a Center-based Classifier (CC) achieves regret proportional toN\log{N}N\log{N}whereNNis the number of labels. To bridge these regimes, we introduce the Generalized Hull-based Classifier (GHC), a practical extension of CHC that allows for more aggressive guessing via a tunable threshold parameter. Our approach is validated with experiments, notably on real-world question-answering datasets using embeddings derived from state-of-the-art large language models.â–³ Less

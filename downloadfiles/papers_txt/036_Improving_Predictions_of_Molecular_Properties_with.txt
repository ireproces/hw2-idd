Title: Improving Predictions of Molecular Properties with Graph Featurisation and Heterogeneous Ensemble Models

Abstract: We explore a "best-of-both" approach to modelling molecular properties by combininglearnedmolecular descriptors from a graph neural network (GNN) with general-purpose descriptors and a mixed ensemble ofmachinelearning(ML) models. We introduce a MetaModel framework to aggregate predictions from a diverse set of leading ML models. We present a featurisation scheme for combining task-specific GNN-derived features with conventional molecular descriptors.
  We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the cutting-edge ChemProp model on all regression datasets tested and 6 of 9 classification datasets. We further show that including the GNN features derived from ChemProp boosts the ensemble model's performance on several datasets where it otherwise would have underperformed. We conclude that to achieve optimal performance across a wide set of problems, it is vital to combine general-purpose descriptors with task-specificlearnedfeatures and use a diverse set of ML models to make the predictions.â–³ Less

Title: Schrodinger Neural Network and Uncertainty Quantification: Quantum

Abstract: We introduce the Schrodinger Neural Network (SNN), a principled architecture for conditional density estimation and uncertainty quantification inspired by quantum mechanics. The SNN maps each input to a normalized wave function on the output domain and computes predictive probabilities via the Born rule. The SNN departs from standard parametric likelihood heads bylearningcomplex coefficients of a spectral expansion (e . g ., Chebyshev polynomials) whose squared modulus yields the conditional densityp(y|x)=\left| ψ_x(y)\right| {}^2p(y|x)=\left| ψ_x(y)\right| {}^2with analytic normalization. This representation confers three practical advantages: positivity and exact normalization by construction, native multimodality through interference among basis modes without explicit mixture bookkeeping, and yields closed-form (or efficiently computable) functionals--such as moments and several calibration diagnostics--as quadratic forms in coefficient space. We develop the statistical and computational foundations of the SNN, including (i) training by exact maximum-likelihood with unit-sphere coefficient parameterization, (ii) physics-inspired quadratic regularizers (kinetic and potential energies) motivated by uncertainty relations between localization and spectral complexity, (iii) scalable low-rank and separable extensions for multivariate outputs, (iv) operator-based extensions that represent observables, constraints, and weak labels as self-adjoint matrices acting on the amplitude space, and (v) a comprehensive framework for evaluating multimodal predictions. The SNN provides a coherent, tractable framework to elevate probabilistic prediction from point estimates to physically inspired amplitude-based distributions.△ Less

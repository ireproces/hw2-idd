Title: Toward Carbon-Neutral Human AI: Rethinking Data, Computation, andParadigms for Sustainable Intelligence

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to unprecedented computational demands, raising significant environmental and ethical concerns. This paper critiques the prevailing reliance on large-scale, static datasets and monolithic training paradigms, advocating for a shift toward human-inspired, sustainable AI solutions. We introduce a novel framework, Human AI (HAI), which emphasizes incrementallearning, carbon-aware optimization, and human-in-the-loop collaboration to enhance adaptability, efficiency, and accountability. By drawing parallels with biological cognition and leveraging dynamic architectures, HAI seeks to balance performance with ecological responsibility. We detail the theoretical foundations, system design, and operational principles that enable AI tolearncontinuously and contextually while minimizing carbon footprints and human annotation costs. Our approach addresses pressing challenges in activelearning, continual adaptation, and energy-efficient model deployment, offering a pathway toward responsible, human-centered artificial intelligence.â–³ Less

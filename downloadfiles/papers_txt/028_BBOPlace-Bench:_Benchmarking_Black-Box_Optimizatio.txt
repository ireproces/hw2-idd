Title: BBOPlace-Bench: Benchmarking Black-Box Optimization for Chip Placement

Abstract: Chip placement is a vital stage in modern chip design as it has a substantial impact on the subsequent processes and the overall quality of the final chip. The use of black-box optimization (BBO) for chip placement has a history of several decades. However, early efforts were limited by immature problem formulations and inefficient algorithm designs. Recent progress has shown the effectiveness and efficiency of BBO for chip placement, proving its potential to achieve state-of-the-art results. Despite these advancements, the field lacks a unified, BBO-specific benchmark for thoroughly assessing various problem formulations and BBO algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose BBOPlace-Bench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating and developing BBO algorithms for chip placement tasks. It integrates three problem formulations of BBO for chip placement, and offers a modular, decoupled, and flexible framework that enables users to seamlessly implement, test, and compare their own algorithms. BBOPlace-Bench integrates a wide variety of existing BBO algorithms, including simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary algorithms (EAs), and Bayesian optimization (BO). Experimental results show that the problem formulations of mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter optimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem formulation, while EAs demonstrate better overall performance than SA and BO, especially in high-dimensional search spaces, and also achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods. BBOPlace-Bench not only facilitates the development of efficient BBO-driven solutions for chip placement but also broadens the practical application scenarios (which are urgently needed) for the BBO community.

Title: Generalized Kantorovich-Rubinstein Duality beyond Hausdorff and Kantorovich

Abstract: The classical Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality guarantees coincidence between metrics on the space of probability distributions defined on the one hand via transport plans (couplings) and on the other hand via price functions. Both constructions have been lifted to the level of generality of set functors, with the coupling-based construction referred to as the Wasserstein lifting, and the price-function-based construction as the Kantorovich lifting, both based on a choice of quantitative modalities for the given functor. It is known that every Wasserstein lifting can be expressed as a Kantorovich lifting; however, the latter in general needs to use additional modalities. We give an example showing that this cannot be avoided in general. We refer to cases in which the same modalities can be used as satisfying the generalized Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality. We establish the generalized Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality in this sense for two important cases: The Lévy-Prokhorov distance on distributions, which finds wide-spread applications inmachinelearningdue to its favourable stability properties, and the standard metric on convex sets of distributions that arises by combining the Hausdorff and Wasserstein distances.△ Less
